TODO stack
----------

* A queries chart as a cloud of dots

* Tables for tops (on every interresting values, both order)

* A max packet size chart, as an histogram

* An eth/ip connection graph (with the usual filters)

* An Interval type

* It would be nice if any reasonably widespread date format were 
understood by Timestamp.read_txt. Or provide a helper function (for better
performances)

* junkie.scm: for http, add an intermediary state between query and answer
matching any packet belonging to this cnx in order to reset the timeout clock.

* Add the possibility to listen on any event in netmatch (like HTTP end of 
body)

* Add payload and its transfert time to web metric


* A repair tool (scanning files and reporting those that cannot be read,
  for later inspection/deletion, or offering to truncate the file (or merely
display file and offset where the error occured))


* Factorize DNS with WEB and ETH.


* Fix multiple writer by flushing in O_APPEND after complete tuples


* In the same spirit than locking, write a file with the textual 
representation of the record type in a table directory (and check it when 
opening the table).


* Think of a way to ensure that when we compute a hash to select a part of
a table we actually hash the correct datatype (ie. Dns0.hash takes a full 
record, extract something then hash this, while Dns0.dump hash a server IP,
check that what Dns0.hash extract is also an IP). Additionally, simplify
the index handling (Dns0.dump is too complex wrt. index)


* Dump should be able to send output to a pipe (ssh compressed tunnel) for
distributed querying
