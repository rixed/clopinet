TODO stack
----------

* Move code from traffic.ml / dns.ml / web.ml into www/index.ml Ctlr.

* Top DNS: VLAN = 0 ??

* Ajouter un check sur stop > start

* Peers : pour chaque A,B sélectionné dans la première passe, calculer
ensuite le traffic exacte entre A et B et aussi le traffic total 
entrant/sortant de A et de B, et afficher ainsi pour tout host le traffic
"autre".

* A queries chart as a cloud of dots

* Tables for tops (on every interresting values, both order)

* A max packet size chart, as an histogram

* An eth/ip connection graph (with the usual filters)

* An Interval type

* In all time charts where the selected period spans no more than 10 days,
display in chart background the night times with a sligh dark-blue bgcolor.

* junkie.scm: for http, add an intermediary state between query and answer
matching any packet belonging to this cnx in order to reset the timeout clock.

* Add the possibility to listen on any event in netmatch (like HTTP end of 
body)

* Add payload and its transfert time to web metric


* A repair tool (scanning files and reporting those that cannot be read,
  for later inspection/deletion, or offering to truncate the file (or merely
display file and offset where the error occured))


* Fix multiple writer by flushing in O_APPEND after complete tuples


* In the same spirit than locking, write a file with the textual 
representation of the record type in a table directory (and check it when 
opening the table).


* Think of a way to ensure that when we compute a hash to select a part of
a table we actually hash the correct datatype (ie. Dns0.hash takes a full 
record, extract something then hash this, while Dns0.dump hash a server IP,
check that what Dns0.hash extract is also an IP). Additionally, simplify
the index handling (Dns0.dump is too complex wrt. index)


* Dump should be able to send output to a pipe (ssh compressed tunnel) for
distributed querying


* IP proto devrait être une selectbox
