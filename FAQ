* Why not Netflow? Why not SNMP?

Netflow would have many advantages: no need to direct all traffic to a single
host, no need to install the sniffer, ability to share collected data with
other tools...

But netflow brings so few informations that only the most basic views would
have been possible.  Gathering data via SNMP would have been even more limited.

With the total traffic, on the other hand, every query and representation
will ever be possible. That's much more fun.

BTW, a netflow collector that would pour into the traffic table is planned.

In the meantime, if the traffic you'd like to see is far away from the probe
then you can:

- use a crypted/compressed GRE or ERSPAN tunnel (the sniffer can detunnel that)?
- install another probe on that remote site, waiting for clopinet remote query
  feature?
- ok you're screwed.


* How come the database is already XXGb big after only a few hours?

DB size grows fast at the begenning and much slower afterward.
This is because many small files are preallocated to several Megabytes.
So what you see is preallocation.
In the beginning you should use `du -b` to estimate growth.

If you want less preallocation you can reduce CPN_DB_MAX_FILE_SIZE
and/or CPN_DB_MAX_HASH_SIZE.
