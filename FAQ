* How come the database is already XXGb big after only a few hours?

DB size grows fast at the begenning and much slower afterward.
This is because many small files are preallocated to several Megabytes.
So what you see is preallocation.
In the beginning you should use `du -b` to estimate growth.

If you want less preallocation you can reduce CPN_DB_MAX_FILE_SIZE
and/or CPN_DB_MAX_HASH_SIZE.
